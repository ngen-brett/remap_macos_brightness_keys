**Remap Brightness Keys**

This script will remap the brightness keys on macOS to "Function" - it is intended to remap them to a keypress which will have minimal impact in the event of an inadvertent keypress.


To install:

1. Download the code and extract it to the default location.
2. Open "Terminal"
3. Run the following commands - you will likely be prompted in the terminal window to enter your login password. This is expected behavior.
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads/remap_macos_brightness_keys
   chmod +x *.sh
   ./install_remap.sh
   ```

To uninstall: (Skip to step 2 if you have already downloaded and extracted)

1. Download the code and extract it to the default location.
2. Open "Terminal"
3. Run the following commands - you will likely be prompted in the terminal window to enter your login password. This is expected behavior.
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads/remap_macos_brightness_keys
   chmod +x *.sh
   ./install_remap.sh
   ```
